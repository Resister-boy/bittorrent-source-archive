bittorrent-source-archive
=========================

This is an unofficial copy of the original BitTorrent source code by Bram Cohen and contributors.

It was taken from the [CVS repo](http://sourceforge.net/p/bittorrent/code/?source=navbar) hosted on Sourceforge, and converted using [cvs2git](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~jacob/cvs2svn/cvs2git.html#usage).

### Why?

BitTorrent was first released in July 2001. It's still going over 20 years later, and so I wanted to read the original source code for the 0.1, which was written in Python.

I couldn't find it online, although [one StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4318969/where-to-find-bittorrent-source-code) suggested you could find the old releases on SourceForge for 0.3. I installed the 
old tooling and checked it out, and lo' and behold, there was CVS metadata for the v0.1 too (which SourceForge didn't show)! Enjoy.
