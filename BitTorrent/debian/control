Description: scatter-gather network file transfer
 BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely                     
 easy to use - downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks.                  
 Whenever more than one person is downloading at once                            
 they send pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus relieving                   
 the central server's bandwidth burden. Even with many                           
 simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server                 
 remains quite small, since each new downloader introduces new                   
 upload capacity.
