install Python, version 2.0 or later - http://python.org/

install wxPython - http://wxpython.org/

(under debian, you can currently get the above 
using apt-get install libwxgtk2.2-python and 
python2.1-dev from testing and use python 2.1)

To install system-wide - 

    untar and cd to the root BitTorrent directory and 
    enter the following command
    
    ./setup.py install
    
    To integrate with your web browser, copy the contents of 
    the file named 'torrent' into your /etc/mailcap file. 
    Under Debian you can do this with 
    cp torrent /usr/lib/mime/packages;update-mime
    (some unixes don't have a mailcap file, if you get it working 
    on one which doesn't, please let me know how)

To install in a specific location -

    untar and put a line in /etc/mailcap which is similar to the 
    one in the file named 'torrent', only replace the path to 
    /usr/bin/btdownloadprefetched.py with the one it's actually in.

You may have to restart your web browser for it to start 
using BitTorrent.

If you're using a web browser which doesn't respect 
/etc/mailcap you can go into the mimetype configuration for 
your web browser and manually associate application/x-bittorrent 
with btdownloadprefetched.py (with the appropriate path, of course.)
