InternetExplorer users:  You must launch BitTorrent with InternetExplorer NOT RUNNING in order to register as a helper app.  This only needs to be done once.

Mozilla:  Restart Mozilla after launching BitTorrent for the first time.

OmniWeb:  OmniWeb doesn't seem to want to auto-launch BT.  Just double-click the .torrent file in the download panel or otherwise open the .torrent file to get things started.


Notes for those creating Torrent files:
BT internally doesn't deal well with files that have spaces in their names.
Be careful of file packages, they may have files containing spaces in their names.
This will hopefully be corrected soon.
