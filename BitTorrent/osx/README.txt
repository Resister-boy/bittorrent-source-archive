InternetExplorer users:  You must launch BitTorrent with InternetExplorer NOT RUNNING in order to register as a helper app.  This only needs to be done once.

Safari:  Safari doesn't automatically hand the torrent file off to BitTorrent.  Open the torrent file to start the download.

Mozilla:  Restart Mozilla after launching BitTorrent for the first time.

OmniWeb:  OmniWeb doesn't auto-launch BT.  Just double-click the .torrent file in the download panel or otherwise open the .torrent file to get things started.

Fixed a bug where torrents larger than about 2 gigabytes would fail.
These builds do not seem to work on 10.1, the cause is being investigated.  For now you need 10.2 "Jaguar"

Release Notes Version 3.1
----------
This release has the latest BitTorrent and also UI for generating torrent files.
Checking the "create a torrent file for each file/folder in this folder..." will create a torrent file only if one does not already exist.  Also, it only creates torrents for the files/foldes in the top level of the chosen folder.
