InternetExplorer users:  You must launch BitTorrent with InternetExplorer NOT RUNNING in order to register as a helper app.  This only needs to be done once.

Mozilla:  Restart Mozilla after launching BitTorrent for the first time.

OmniWeb:  OmniWeb doesn't seem to want to auto-launch BT.  Just double-click the .torrent file in the download panel or otherwise open the .torrent file to get things started.


Release Notes Version 3.1
----------
This release has the latest BitTorrent and also UI for generating torrent files.
Checking the "create a torrent file for each file/folder in this folder..." will create a torrent file only if one does not already exist.  Also, it only creates torrents for the files/foldes in the top level of the chosen folder.
