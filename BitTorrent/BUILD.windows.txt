install Python, version 2.0 or later - http://python.org/

install wxPython - http://wxpython.org/

install py2exe - http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/

install the nullsoft installer - http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/

in a shell, go to the root BitTorrent directory and run this command

python winsetup.py py2exe --windows

change to the newly created subdirectory dist\btdownloadprefetched,
copy bittorrent.nsi into that directory, and run nsis on it.

cd dist\btdownloadprefetched
copy ..\..\bittorrent.nsi bittorrent.nsi
c:\progra~1\nsis\makensis.exe bittorrent.nsi

This will create an installer called bittorrent.exe

The installer is completely self-contained and will work on any 
Windows machine, even without the above software having been 
installed.
