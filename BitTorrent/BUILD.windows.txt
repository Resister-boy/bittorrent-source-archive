install Python, version 2.0 or later - http://python.org/

install wxPython - http://wxpython.org/

install the nullsoft installer - http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/

Copy this file into the root BitTorrent directory*

http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/_StreamEncrypter.pyd

in a shell, go to the root BitTorrent directory and run this command

python winsetup.py py2exe --windows

change to the newly created subdirectory dist\btdownloadprefetched 
and run nsis on bittorrent.nsi

c:\progra~1\nsis\makensis.exe ..\..\bittorrent.nsi

This will create an installer called bittorrent.exe

The installer is completely self-contained and will work on any 
Windows machine, even without the above software having been 
installed.

* If for some odd reason you wish to build _StreamEncrypter yourself 
and happen to have a copy of MSVC installed, you can run 
'setup.py build' and move the newly created _StreamEncrypter.pyd 
(which will be under a subdirectory of the newly created directory 
named 'build') into the root BitTorrent directory.
