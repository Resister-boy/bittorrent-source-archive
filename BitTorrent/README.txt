BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely 
easy to use - downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks.
Whenever more than one person is downloading at once 
they send pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus relieving 
bandwidth burden on the central server. Even with many 
simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server 
remains quite small, since each new downloader introduces new 
upload capacity.

BitTorrent consists of three parts - tracker, which acts as a 
web server, publisher, which acts as an always-up peer, and the 
client portion which acts as a web helper app.

Windows web browser support is added by running an installer. 
Instructions for making the installer are in BUILD.windows.txt

Instructions for Unix installation and running a tracker and 
publisher are in INSTALL.unix.txt

Currently running a tracker or publisher under windows is clumsy 
since they're both command line applications.
