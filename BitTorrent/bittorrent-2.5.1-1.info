Description: A tool for distributing files.
DescDetail: <<
BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely
easy to use - downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks.
Whenever more than one person is downloading at once
they send pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus relieving
bandwidth burden on the central server. Even with many
simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server
remains quite small, since each new downloader introduces new
upload capacity.
